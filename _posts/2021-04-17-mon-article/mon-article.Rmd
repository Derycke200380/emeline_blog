 In conclusion, I am happy to have chosen this topic because the heart is an organ that interests me a lot. I was aware of some of the dangers, but for example, I didn't know that the menopause could have a negative effect on cardiovascular disease, or that drinking coffee or sugary drinks has an impact on our heart activity.
 
In general, I enjoyed going to sites to find articles, although it took me quite a while. I was also able to learn some extra words in English regarding the lexical field of heart diseases/problems. 
So, I hope that you, the people who took the time to look my blog, were able to learn a little more about hearts and heart problems.
