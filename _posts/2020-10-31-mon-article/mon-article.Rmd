## Analysis about the study 
* Researchers:

Soroka University Medical Centre, Beer Sheva, IsraelIsrael. (lead author: Dr Westreich)

* Published in? when:

Science daily  (26/08/2020)

* General topic:

 A salivary test could help us detect a heart attack. Thanks to the detection of a protein called troponin. 

* Procedure: what was examined:

   + the researchers took samples of saliva, people with heat damage and healthy people
   + one part of the sample will be processed and the other will not
   + the treated saliva samples were positive for troponin. So  there is troponin in the saliva
   
* Conclusions:

   + create a prototype of a processed saliva test
   + more accurate than the blood test 

* Remaining questions:

Nothing
