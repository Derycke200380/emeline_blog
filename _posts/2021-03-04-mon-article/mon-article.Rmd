## Analysis about the study 
* Researchers :

Florida State University : Stephen Chelko, an assistant professor of biomedical sciences, has developed a better understanding of the pathological characteristics behind the disease.

* Published in? when:

 Science Translational Medicine. in the current issue of the store i.e. at the same time as it appeared on the site.

Florida state unversity news (17/02/2021)

* General topic:

This article talks about one of the main causes of sudden cardiac death. it is arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. It is a hereditary genetic disease in which healthy heart muscle is replaced by scar tissue and fat.

* Procedure: what was examined:

   + mutations cause arrhythmia, can be fatal if not properly treated
   + physical exercise can be good for the body but can lead to cell death in individuals with the arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
   + mitochondria also have a role. if they no longer function, myocarditis cells are replaced by fat
   + electrical signals from the heart are reduced
   + disrupts the heart's impulses, resulting in an inability to pump blood during exercise

* Conclusions:

   + pathogenic role of exercise-induced cell death more by the mitochondria
   + cell death can be prevented by inhibiting two proteins
   + paves the way for the development of new therapeutic options

* Remaining questions:

Nothing
